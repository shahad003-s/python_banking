![Golden Dune Bank](./Golden%20Dune%20Bank%20(3).png)


## Project Description

Welcome to the Golden Dune Bank Python Banking System! This project simulates a banking environment where customers can have checking and savings accounts, withdraw and deposit money, transfer funds, and more. The system also implements overdraft protection and ensures that customers can only access their own information. It uses Python classes, file handling, and the CSV module to manage data.

The goal of this project is to showcase how to build a simple, but functional banking application using Python and the CSV format to store account data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **CSV module** (for reading and writing account data)

## Challenges / Key Takeaways
- No challenges yet! If any challenges arise during the development process, I will update this section accordingly. Stay tuned!

### To Run the Project:

1. `bank.csv`: Contains account information. It is used to persist data.
2. `banking.py`: Contains all the Python code for handling user interactions. It also manages account creation and overdraft protection.
3. `bank_csv.py`: Used to create and populate the `bank.csv` file with some initial data if it's missing.

---

### To Run the Project:

1. If the `bank.csv` file doesn't already exist, run `bank_csv.py` to generate initial data.
2. Run `banking.py` to start the banking application.
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the system.
